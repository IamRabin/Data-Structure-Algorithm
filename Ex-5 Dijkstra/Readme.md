# Weighted Graphs

## Objective:

The objective of this exercise was to implement the following points:


    * Implement the array-based version of the Dijkstra's algorithm

    * Implement the binary heap-based version of the Dijkstra's algorithm.

    * Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and  compare their execution times.

## Overview:
   The folder contains graph_routines header file which provides various data structure for benchmarking the Dijkstra algorithm performance in dijkstra.cc file.

## Compiling :

Makefile will leverage to produce the executable using the command `make`. All the timings generated in the executable are in nanoseconds.
