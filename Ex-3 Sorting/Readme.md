# Implementation of Sorting Algorithms

## Objective :

The objective of this exercise was to implement sorting algorithm as follows :
* Implement Insertion Sort and Quick Sort.

* Implement Heap Sort by using binary heap implementation required by the homework on heaps.

* Implement Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.

* Implement the Select Algorithm.

* Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and evaluate their execution times.

* Prove by testing that both Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take time `O(n^2)` in the worst case.

* Prove by testing that Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take in the best case time `O(n)` and `O(n log n)` respectively.

* Why did we assume that there were no repeated values in A? Generalize the implementation of the Select Algorithm to also deal with repeated values.

## Overview :

In this exercise we have implemented various sorting algorithms and each executable file generates the elapsed time in nanoseconds for each sorting algorithm. The header file sort_routine.h includes the common helper router routines used by `.c ` files.The best case and worst case for insertion sort ,quick sort has been demonstrated and the difference is more pronounced with bigger sizes of array.

## Compiling:
`Make ` will yield the executable file which produces the elapsed time for different sorting algorithm .
