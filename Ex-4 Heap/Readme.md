# Implementing Heaps

## Objective:
The objective of this exercise was to implement array based implementation of  binary heap and testing the implementation on some example problem to observe the execution time of heapify .

## Overview

The folder contains header file and the main function file which implements the testing of the heapify program.

## Compiling:
The command `make ` will produce the executable which will give us the elapsed time recorded for different problem size. The timings recorded are in nanoseconds.
